# Titanic
Basic ML project on predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Python file is a readable version of the Jupyter Notebook file.
The best model achieves a validation accuracy of 85% and a test accuracy of 76% â€” based on the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

## Libraries used:
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [TensorFlow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## ML techniques used:
